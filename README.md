# ROS workshop of SZE-JKK
 The workshop was held in February of 2018, at the Széchenyi István University of Győr, Hungary.
 
 Code used from the following repositories and/or websites:
 - http://www.ev3dev.org/: as the EV3 firmware is open-source, these guys created a Linux distro compatible with the EV3.
 - https://github.com/ddemidov/ev3dev-lang-cpp: the EV3 demos are written with the help of this library. To run the examples, you shall need this extension.
 - https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml: wonderful resource (and repository) to start with machine learning and particularly with Tensorflow. I acknowledge, that I used the code for the RL OpenAI Gym Tensorflow example, with only little additions to the original code (https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml/blob/master/16_reinforcement_learning.ipynb).
